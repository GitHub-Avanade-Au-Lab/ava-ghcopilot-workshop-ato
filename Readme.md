# GitHub Copilot Training

This repository is used for the GitHub Copilot Developer Training Conducted by Avanade.

The repository contains code snippets that can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of GitHub Copilot.

## Pre-requisites

In order to follow along with the instructions provided in this repository, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GitHub Copilot Access](https://copilot.github.com/)
- GitHub Copilot Extension for Visual Studio Code
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for JavaScript/TypeScript code and exercises
- Jest for Unit Testing JavaScript/TypeScript code - `npm install --save-dev jest`
- .NET SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks) for C# exercises
- [CodeTour VS Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) - (Recommended if you want to perform the demos and exercises later on)

## Getting Started

In order to get started with GitHub Copilot, you will need to install the GitHub Copilot extension in your IDE. Once you have installed the extension, you can start using it to generate code snippets.

### CodeTour

CodeTour is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to create a guided tour of your codebase. This can be used to help new developers onboard to a project or to provide a guided tour of a repository.

This repository also contains CodeTour files that you can use to get a guided tour of the repository. To get started with CodeTour, you will need to install the CodeTour extension in your IDE.

Once CodeTour is installed, you will see a new CODETOUR section under the VS Code activity bar.
