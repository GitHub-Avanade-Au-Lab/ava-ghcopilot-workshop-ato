      "description": "# Context is Key\nContext provides the necessary backdrop that informs the purpose and function of the code. \n\nFor GitHub Copilot, context comes from comments, code structure, and opened files that guide its AI to generate relevant and useful suggestions. \n\nBy feeding it descriptive comments and clear code patterns from other files, Copilot can better understand the intent behind code segments and assist in crafting suggestions tailored to your needs.\n\nLet's dive into a simple yet insightful example that showcases how Copilot interprets our comments to provide intelligent completions.\n\n> Tip: You can hide this CodeTour instructions by clicking the Up ^ icon, at the top right corner, beside the pencil icon to hide. Simply click the chat icon to the left, beside the Line number to show the instructions again.\n\nLet's begin with a straightforward Q&A comment in our demo.py file. I will write simple Q&A written in python comments and let Github Copilot suggest an answer.\n\n```python\n# Question: What are the popular JavaScript frameworks?\n# Answer:\n```\n\nAfter pasting the comment, put your cursor after the colon in \"Answer:\" and press the `Spacebar`\n\nCopilot's suggestion will appear in a translucent text, usually referred to as \"Ghost Text\". Simply press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.\n\nPress `Next` to continue ðŸ‘‡",

The GitHub Copilot icon at the bottom left corner of VS Code will change into a circulating icon, which means it's still gathering relevant suggestions.\n\nWhile GitHub Copilot operates across various programming languages, remember to use the language-specific commenting character, such as # for Python or double slash `//` for JavaScript, to provide context. This ensures Copilot accurately interprets your intent and offers the most suitable suggestions for your code.\n\nPress `Next` to continue ðŸ‘‡",

It doesn't need to have the name context.js. It can be an existing `.js, .py, .java` file that contains existing code patterns in your project.\n\nA feature of Copilot is that it adapts to Context based on the other files that are open. By having relevant files adjacent to the one you are working on, Copilot might give a more suitable suggestion or even match the pattern how functions in your project are written. In a real-world scenario, you can open other files in your current project and use that as guidance for Copilot to suggest, enabling you to follow your development standards while using GitHub Copilot.\n\n\n",
