For GitHub Copilot, context comes from comments, code structure, and naming conventions that guide its AI to generate relevant and useful suggestions. By feeding it descriptive comments and clear code patterns, Copilot can better understand the intent behind code segments and assist in crafting suggestions tailored to the developer's needs\n\nLet's dive into a simple yet illuminating example that showcases how Copilot interprets our comments to provide intelligent completions.\n\nWe've begun with a straightforward Q&A comment in our demo.py file. I will write simple Q&A written in python comments and let Github Copilot suggest an answer.\n\n```python\n# Question: What are the popular JavaScript frameworks?\n# Answer:\n```\n\n\nPress `Next` to to get continue ðŸ‘‡",
