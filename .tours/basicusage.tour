      "description": "# Context is Key\nContext provides the necessary backdrop that informs the purpose and function of the code. \n\nWhen someone asks you \"Hey, can you help me with something?\". Often times, we respond back \"Sure\", then you find out that the other person is asking you to carry 50 Kilograms of luggage over 5 flights of stairs. You need to know the context first so you'll know if you can really help or not.\n\nFor GitHub Copilot, context comes from comments, code structure, and opened files that guide its AI to generate relevant and useful suggestions. \n\nBy feeding it descriptive comments and clear code patterns from other files, Copilot can better understand the intent behind code segments and assist in crafting suggestions tailored to your needs.\n\nLet's dive into a simple yet insightful example that showcases how Copilot interprets our comments to provide intelligent completions.\n\n> Tip: You can hide this CodeTour instructions by clicking the Collapse ^ icon, at the top right corner, beside the pencil icon. Simply click the chat icon to the left, beside the Line number to show the instructions again.\n\nLet's begin with a straightforward Q&A comment in our demo.py file. I will write simple Q&A written in python comments and let Github Copilot suggest an answer.\n\n```python\n# Question: What are the popular JavaScript frameworks?\n# Answer:\n```\n\nAfter pasting the comment, put your cursor after the colon in \"Answer:\" and press the `Spacebar`\n\nCopilot's suggestion will appear in a translucent text, usually referred to as \"Ghost Text\". Simply press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.\n\nPress `Next` to continue ðŸ‘‡",

The GitHub Copilot icon at the bottom left corner of VS Code will change into a circulating icon, which means it's still gathering relevant suggestions.\n\nWhile GitHub Copilot operates across various programming languages, remember to use the language-specific commenting character, such as # for Python or double slash `//` for JavaScript, to provide context. This ensures Copilot accurately interprets your intent and offers the most suitable suggestions for your code.\n\nPress `Next` to continue ðŸ‘‡",

Without explicitly asking it to do so, it suggested documentation about the functions first. This is because we've kept context.js opened as a neighboring file. Copilot uses this file as additional context to recommend suggestions.\n\nIf you recall our first demo, it immediately went on to suggest the function because we didn't have context.js file opened.\n\n## A Context file can be any file\n\nNote that `context.js` could be any other file in your code base. It doesn't need to have the name context.js. It can be an existing `.js, .py, .java` file that contains existing code patterns in your project.\n\nA feature of Copilot is that it adapts to Context based on the other files that are open. By having relevant files adjacent to the one you are working on, Copilot might give a more suitable suggestion or even match the pattern how functions in your project are written. In a real-world scenario, you can open other files in your current project and use that as guidance for Copilot to suggest, enabling you to follow your development standards while using GitHub Copilot.\n\n\n",

      "description": "# Recap of Basic Usage\n\nThroughout this topic, we've explored various aspects of GitHub Copilot and its integration with your coding workflow. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n- **Context is Crucial**: We've seen how providing clear and descriptive context through comments and code structure can significantly influence the suggestions made by GitHub Copilot. This includes using language-specific comments and having related files open.\n\n- **Leveraging Suggestions**: GitHub Copilot can generate code snippets, complete functions, and even suggest tests based on the context you provide. We've practiced accepting, modifying, and iterating on these suggestions to fit our specific needs.\n\n- **Refactoring and Error Handling**: The AI can assist with refactoring code and adding error handling by understanding directives given in natural language within the comments.\n\n- **Testing and Inputs**: We've also seen how Copilot can help with writing simple test cases and handling user input, demonstrating its versatility across different stages of development.\n\n- **Language Adaptability**: GitHub Copilot's suggestions adapt to the language you're working with, as shown in the switch from JavaScript to Python examples.\n\n- **Best Practices**: By using clear naming conventions, providing detailed context, and keeping relevant code files open, we can train Copilot to better match our coding standards and handle edge cases.\n\nRemember, while GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool for increasing productivity, it's essential to review and understand the code it generates to ensure it meets your project's requirements and adheres to best practices.\n\nPress `Finish` to complete this tour. ðŸŽ‰"
