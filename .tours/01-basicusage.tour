Often times, we respond back \"Sure\", then you find out that the other person is asking you to carry 50 Kilograms of luggage over 5 flights of stairs. You need to know the context first so you'll know if you can really help or not.\n\nFor GitHub Copilot, context comes from comments, code structure, and opened files that guide its AI to generate relevant and useful suggestions. \n\nLet's begin with a straightforward Q&A comment in our demo.py file. I will write simple Q&A written in python comments and let Github Copilot suggest an answer.\n\n```python\n# Question: What are the popular JavaScript frameworks?\n# Answer:\n```\n\nAfter pasting the comment, put your cursor after the colon in \"Answer:\" and press the `Spacebar`\n\nCopilot's suggestion will appear in a translucent text, usually referred to as \"Ghost Text\". Simply press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.\n\nPress `Next` to continue ðŸ‘‡",

The GitHub Copilot icon at the bottom left corner of VS Code will change into a circulating icon, which means it's still gathering relevant suggestions.\n\nRemember to use the language-specific commenting character, such as # for Python or double slash `//` for JavaScript, `<!--comment-->` for HTML.

      "description": "# Recap of Basic Usage\n\nThroughout this topic, we've explored various aspects of GitHub Copilot and its integration with your coding workflow. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n- **Context is Crucial**: We've seen how providing clear and descriptive context through comments and code structure can significantly influence the suggestions made by GitHub Copilot. This includes using language-specific comments and having related files open.\n\n- **Leveraging Suggestions**: GitHub Copilot can generate code snippets, complete functions, and even suggest tests based on the context you provide. We've practiced accepting, modifying, and iterating on these suggestions to fit our specific needs.\n\n- **Refactoring and Error Handling**: The AI can assist with refactoring code and adding error handling by understanding directives given in natural language within the comments.\n\n- **Testing and Inputs**: We've also seen how Copilot can help with writing simple test cases and handling user input, demonstrating its versatility across different stages of development.\n\n- **Language Adaptability**: GitHub Copilot's suggestions adapt to the language you're working with, as shown in the switch from JavaScript to Python examples.\n\n- **Best Practices**: By using clear naming conventions, providing detailed context, and keeping relevant code files open, we can train Copilot to better match our coding standards and handle edge cases.\n\nRemember, while GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool for increasing productivity, it's essential to review and understand the code it generates to ensure it meets your project's requirements and adheres to best practices.\n\nPress `Finish` to complete this tour. ðŸŽ‰"
