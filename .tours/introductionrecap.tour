They provide an overview of GitHub Copilot, including details specific to your group that are pertinent to effectively leveraging the tool in your projects.\r\n\r\n# Codetour\r\n\r\nFor this training, I will be using Codetour, a separate VS Code extension that allows me to use a guided flow for this training. It is not related in any way to GitHub Copilot.\r\n\r\n# Hands-On Demo Practice\r\n\r\nDuring the training, you'll have the opportunity to actively engage in the demos. I'll encourage you to perform the exercises independently to observe the outputs firsthand.\r\n",

You may receive a message saying \"Sorry, the response matched public code so it was blocked...\"\r\n\r\nThis is expected when Copilot detects that what its about to suggest is a Copyrighted code.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to rephrase your prompt by providing a different field names, for example, renaming 'username' to 'developername' and 'email' to 'developeremail.' Get creative with your solutions and share any successful methods with the community.",

Choose the IDE you prefer and start coding with AI assistance.\r\n\r\n### Awaiting Xcode Integration\r\nThere's no direct GitHub Copilot support for Xcode yet. Developers can work around this by using VS Code in tandem with Xcode for AI-powered code completions.\r\n"
