      "description": "## Streamlit\r\n\r\nStreamlit is a rapid development Python framework designed for creating data-centric web apps with minimal code. It streamlines the creation of interactive dashboards, offering a simple API to integrate widgets and visualize data effortlessly. Ideal for data scientists and engineers, Streamlit facilitates sharing insights without the need for extensive web dev skills, relying on pure Python for most operations.\r\n\r\nHere's a basic example of a Python code using the Streamlit Web framework\r\n\r\n### Simple Streamlit Code\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\n# Title of the web app\r\nst.title('Square Number Calculator')\r\n\r\n# User input\r\ninput_num = st.number_input('Enter a number', value=0)\r\n\r\n# Calculate square\r\nsquare = input_num ** 2\r\n\r\n# Display the square of the input number\r\nst.write('The square of', input_num, 'is', square)\r\n```"

This breakdown is provided for each language-editor combination.\r\n\r\n### Load the data\r\n\r\nNow that we know what our data is about, let's feed it into our application.\r\n\r\nSwitch to the browser where the app is running, then click Browse files and select usage.csv\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It just trusted what I provided is true and used that to suggest a code snippet.\r\n\r\nThis is where the importance of providing context come into play. We need to provide Copilot an idea of the structure of the csv file so it can use that as context when generating its suggestion.\r\n\r\nLet's now add more context into our instructions. I've prepared a file called usage.md where I've stored a markdown format of the csv data with two rows. This will be enough to provide Copilot context on the structure of the csv.\r\n\r\nOpen C:\\Projects\\ghcpdemo\\complete\\csv\\usage.md then copy the markdown table\r\n\r\n### Revised instructions\r\n\r\n```text\r\nI want to add a line chart that visualises the suggestions versus acceptance counts by day\r\n\r\nRefer to the column names as shown in the example markdown table below:\r\n\r\n| breakdown_language | breakdown_editor | breakdown_suggestions_count | breakdown_acceptances_count | breakdown_lines_suggested | breakdown_lines_accepted | breakdown_active_users | day        | total_suggestions_count | total_acceptances_count | total_lines_suggested | total_lines_accepted | total_active_users |\r\n| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |\r\n| polyglot-notebook  | vscode           | 11                          | 3                           | 12                        | 3                        | 2                      | 10/03/2024 | 451                     | 82                      | 896                   | 137                  | 6                  |\r\n| python             | vscode           | 15                          | 2                           | 23                        | 2                        | 2                      | 10/03/2024 | 451                     | 82                      | 896                   | 137                  | 6                  |\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's now copy this entire thing and pop it in to the Chat.\r\n\r\n(Observe Copilot's suggestion)\r\n\r\nPress `Next` to continue\r\n"

      "title": "More Context better results",
      "description": "### With good context comes good suggestions\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Copilot was smart enough to infer that breakdown_suggestions_count and breakdown_acceptance count are the columns to be used in generating the chart, even though we only mentioned \"suggestion\" and \"acceptance\".\r\n\r\nThis is the power of Context. With enough context, Copilot chat will take care of connecting the dots as best as it can.\r\n\r\nProviding an example data structure will enable Copilot to suggest more relevant results based that example.\r\n\r\nLet's now overwrite the contents of analysedata.py with this new suggestion and try it out.\r\n\r\n(Copy the code, save then re-run the application)\r\n\r\nPress `Next` to continue"

This is the limit that Copilot chat can handle. \r\n\r\nAs of this writing, 4096 tokens is the context window, or around 4,000+ words. This is enough to write a short story, but remember the three S's in our prompt crafting session? Simple, Short and Specific.\r\n\r\nSo be cautious of copying large amounts of error logs into Copilot chat as it may hallucinate or provide inaccurate suggestions due to the large amount of context you provide it.\r\n\r\nUse your best judgement and only provide the relevant error stack that you need Copilot chat help with.\r\n\r\n"
