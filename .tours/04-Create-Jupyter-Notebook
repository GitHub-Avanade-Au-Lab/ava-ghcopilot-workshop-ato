Include the steps in installing the require packages as the first step in the Notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Python Virtual Environment\r\n\r\nIt is always recommend that when working with Python notebooks, is to isolate your dependencies using Python venv or Conda.\r\nThis will allow you to work on different versions of Python and modules without impacting your other work.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n.\\ghcp\\scripts\\activate (Windows)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsource ghcp/scripts/activate (Unix)\r\n```"
