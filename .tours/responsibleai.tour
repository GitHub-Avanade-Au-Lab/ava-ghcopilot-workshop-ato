Ensure you validate Copilot's suggestions against the latest information from official SDK documentations of the language you're using.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's ask Copilot chat, \"Which version of ReactJS can you help me with?\", then take the provided answer as a starting point and confirm with the official React documentation to guarantee accuracy.\r\n",

Use a .copilotignore file to prevent certain files or folders from influencing Copilot's suggestions, just like. gitignore does for Git. And keep secrets safe, like storing them in a .env file (Python) and exclude it (.gitignore) from your repos to protect your sensitive data – even when it’s used for testing.",
