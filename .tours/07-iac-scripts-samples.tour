Open `exercise\\PowerShell\\get-folder-sizes.ps1` or `exercise\\bash\\get-folder-sizes.sh`. This should be blank. Then ask copilot chat the above instructions.\r\n\r\n2. In the Chat window, paste this \"Create a PowerShell script that accepts a local directory path on a Windows machine and lists the size of the child folders and folder names under that path.\" (Change PowerShell to Bash if you're on Mac)\r\n\r\n3. Click Insert to Cursor the response from Copilot chat.\r\n\r\n4. Save the file, then execute the following commands in the terminal:\r\n\r\n    - CD to exercise\\PowerShell\r\n    - .\\get-folder-sizes.ps1 -directoryPath \"C:\\ProjectDemos\" (Change the directory path with any of your local folder)\r\n\r\nObserve the result\r\n\r\nPress `Next` to Continue\r\n\r\n"

How do I undo the commit?\r\n```\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOr you can also ask this...\r\n\r\n```text\r\nList all the most common git commands used by developers and provide explanation to each one.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThink of GitHub Copilot chat as your own ChatGPT that resides inside your IDE and responds primarily to IT-related questions. It can also address other technical queries, such as 'How do I design an API?' Even if you don't explicitly ask for a code suggestion, it will still respond to your requests. That's how powerful and useful Copilot chat is."
