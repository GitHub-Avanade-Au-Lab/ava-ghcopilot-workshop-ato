# Tank Game Challenge:

The goal of this challenge is to apply what you've learned with using GitHub Copilot chat. Your task is to come up with the right questions to ask Copilot to help you complete this basic JavaScript game based on an old game "Tanks".

## Objective of the game:
To play the game, the player must use the arrow keys to move the angle of the tank's gun and the space bar to shoot a bullet. The goal is to hit the black box (target) with the bullet.

## Controls:
- `Up Arrow` - Move the tank gun angle up.
- `Down Arrow` - Move the tank gun angle down.
- `Left Arrow` - Decrease the tank's gun power.
- `Right Arrow` - Increase the tank's gun power.
- `Space Bar` - Shoot the bullet.


## Challenges:
Complete the following challenges using GitHub Copilot chat to fix or revise the tankgame.js.

> Hint: Before asking Copilot, highlight the entire contents of the `tankgame.js` file. Then start writing you questions in the chat. 

> Remember: If you don't get the response you were expecting, try rephrasing the question or breaking it down into smaller questions.

List of challenges:

1.) Add physics to the bullet trajectory with configurable air resistance and gravity. Adding physics to the bullet will make it more realistic and challenging to hit the target. (refer to GIF above.)

> This may sound complex, but it's actually really simple. You can start by asking Copilot how to add physics to the bullet trajectory. Then ask how to add air resistance and gravity to the bullet. 

2.) Change the fill color of the Tank rectangle to green. Then the circle fill with dark gray.

3.) Change the color of the bullet to red.

4.) Change the playable canvas area to use the entire browser window. When the window is resized, the canvas should resize accordingly.

5.) Add a background image to the canvas. Image is available at `exercise\javascript\tank-game\image\background.jpg`. 

## 99% of `tankgame.js` were code suggestions

 The completed code of the game is under completed/javascript/tank-game/tankgame.js and was fully generated by GitHub Copilot. Only the comments were added manually.
