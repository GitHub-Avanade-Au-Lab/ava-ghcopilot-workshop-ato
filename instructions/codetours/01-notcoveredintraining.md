# We will not talk about...

As we get started, I want to set the stage for what today's discussion will cover and, just as importantly, what it will not include.

## Programming Language Leading Practices

- While programming language best practices are essential to software development, our focus today is specifically on the Copilot tool.
- We aim to understand how Copilot functions and assists in coding, rather than discussing broader programming methodologies.
- Think of Copilot as a co-pilot in your coding journey, here to support rather than teach the fundamentals of programming languages.

## Code Editor or IDE Functionalities (except relevant to Copilot)

- There is a vast array of functionalities within code editors and IDEs, but today we'll concentrate only on those aspects that intersect with Copilot's features.
- Our discussion will be on how Copilot integrates and enhances these tools, providing a seamless coding experience.
- Consider how Copilot's capabilities can be applied within your preferred coding environment to streamline your workflow.

## Product Roadmap or Future Features

- It's always exciting to speculate about future developments, but today we'll keep our attention on the current state of Copilot.
- Understanding what Copilot offers now is crucial for effectively utilizing the tool in your current projects.
- Let's focus on maximizing the potential of Copilot's existing features to improve your productivity and code quality today.
