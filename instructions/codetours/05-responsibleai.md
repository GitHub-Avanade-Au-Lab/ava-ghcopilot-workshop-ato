# Responsible AI with GitHub Copilot Summary

- **Human Review**: Always verify GitHub Copilot's code suggestions for correctness, security, and adherence to best practices. Copilot's suggestions are not guaranteed to be error-free.
- **Originality**: Copilot may suggest code similar to existing public code. Use the "Block suggestions matching public code" setting to manage this.
- **Up-to-Date Information**: Copilot's programming tips might not reflect the latest updates. Cross-reference with official documentation for the most current language features or tools.
  - _Example_: Query Copilot about the latest version of ReactJS and compare its response with official sources.
- **Sensitive Data**: Be cautious not to input sensitive or PII into Copilot. Utilize `.copilotignore` to exclude files from Copilot's influence, akin to `.gitignore` for Git. Secure secrets in files like `.env` and ensure they are ignored by Git.
