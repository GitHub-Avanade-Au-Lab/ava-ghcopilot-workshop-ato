//Best practices for functions in C#:
// 1. Functions should be small and do one thing. They should not be large and do many things.
// 2. Functions should have a clear name that describes what the function does.
// 3. Functions should have a clear return type. If the function does not return a value, use void.
// 4. Functions should have clear parameters. If the function does not take any parameters, leave the parentheses empty.
// 5. Functions should have a clear body that is easy to read and understand.
// 6. Functions should have a clear purpose. If the function does not have a clear purpose, it should be refactored or removed.
// 7. Functions should be tested to ensure they work as expected.
// 8. Functions should be documented with comments to explain what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.
// 9. Functions should be organized in a logical way within the codebase.
// 10. Functions should be used to encapsulate logic and make the code easier to read and maintain.
